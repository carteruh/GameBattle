# GameBattle
This project focues on the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Pointers to create an interactive turn-based MMO game. The game is designed to play with 2 players and can choose from two classes, Archer or Soldier class. Each class has a specific set of weapons to choose from and has their own damage and cost levels. The game will end once a player reaches less than 0 health.
